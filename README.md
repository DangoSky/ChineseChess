# Chinese chess on the web  

## Technology stack
jQuery + ajax + php

## Introduction
If both parties enter the same room number, it is a double mode. Otherwise, it is in single mode.

This version of Chinese chess does not verify the two players, which means either side can control red and black chess. So consciously abide by the rules of playing chess.   

## The rules of the game
First click on the chess pieces you want to move (the red flag should be carried first), and then click on the position you want to move. If you follow the rules of Chinese chess, you can move successfully. The red and black sides alternate until the end of the game.

## Expected improvement
Rebuild the project with Vue and support for mobile gaming.
